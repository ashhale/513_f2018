### Original Problem Statement and Goals

__*The problem:*__ People not proficient in HTML or CSS having trouble creating the UI for their website from scratch.

__*Solution:*__ Create a web-based application that anyone could use that would help them scope out how they want their website to look and then generate and give them the code which they could copy/paste into their file(s) (maybe an import/export function in the future). This app would only help with the look of the website and not the coding of widgets within the website (such as a button changing the background color whenever pressed).

__*Why:*__ Even though there are tools already out there to help with this, such as WordPress and Wix, they require monthly subscription and are not very great for those who want to experiment and learn. This would give a free option for those looking for more freedom than Wix or Wordpress have to offer.

__*How:*__ I would use my CS server website [weblab.cs.uml.edu/~ahale/513_f2018][2] to host the project. There will be a page on the website where the user would have a "canvas" area where they could drag/drop/manipulate objects and text-boxes wherever they want. Then they will click a button that would generate the code for the "canvas" area and print it to the screen in another window.
