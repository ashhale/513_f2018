# Weekly Update 2018-12-04

* The project can be seen in action at [http://weblab.cs.uml.edu/~ahale/513_f2018/][1]
  * To see the generated HTML, add some shapes to the canvas, maybe update a few, then click the Save button. Open the saved HTML in a browser, and then view source code. (Right click on the page and select View Page Source.)
* Code and feature updates this week
  * Functionality:
    * Generate more detailed HTML for each individual image instead of a single background image. This is more useful to someone using the generated HTML as a starting point for their final version.
    * Implemented rich handling of Text, both in the app for adding and updating Text, and in the generated HTML. This required significant updates to the functions getShapeAttributes, setSelectedShapeAttributes, and generateHTML.
    * Modified Object Info tab to use more specific kinds of INPUT widgets; e.g., a number field for numeric values, a color picker for colors, and a checkbox for boolean values.
  * Code cleanup:
    * Move all JavaScript out of index.html - I did not consider this a "problem to solve" in past weeks, but it's time to be better about separating the view and the features. I did some research on the HTML/JavaScript page lifecycle to determine that execution of some JavaScript code needed to wait until some prerequisite objects existed in the DOM.
    * Reorganize sidebar.js to make it easier to read, with major sections clearly labeled, and some additional comments.
    * The new color picker widget requires colors be specified in RGB hex codes. To keep the code more readable, used a new JavaScript library for a name2hex function.

* Problems and how they were solved
  * How to generate useful HTML for a Konva Text, rather than generating it as an image.
    * This required a lot of research into what text/font/wrap/etc. attributes were available in CSS to represent the corresponding attributes provided by Konva Text objects. See readings below.
    * The end results were included in function generateHTML
  * Bugs from earlier updates fixed this week:
    * BUG: Edit Circle (e.g., radius, or x/y), click Update button, see that the drawing updates. But if you then click on the Circle that you just updated, it disappears. Immediately click on Menu button and see that Object Info still shows the info for the Circle. In fact, you can edit/update it and it redraws the circle again.  So it's still there, but need to figure out why it hides when clicked
      * This turned out to be an issue with numeric attributes of Konva Shapes being set to string values instead of numeric values
    * BUG: If you use the Delete key to delete a shape while the Object Info tab is open, the Object Info tab does not get cleared
      * Created function clearObjectInfo which resets the Object Info tab to default instructional text.
  * Problems remaining
    * Fix positioning of Circles and Ellipses in generated HTML
      * These require a little math to get the top left corner coordinates right.
    * The handling of the display and generation of ellipses in Text objects is not working right
