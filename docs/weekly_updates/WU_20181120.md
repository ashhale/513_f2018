# Weekly Update 2018-11-20

* The project can be seen in action at [http://weblab.cs.uml.edu/~ahale/513_f2018/][2]
* Continued work on improving sidebar appearance and functionality
  * Added an update button to the Object Info tab
    * When something is changed in the Object Info tab and the update button is pressed the canvas will redraw with the shape's attributes updated (ONLY WORKS FOR CIRCLE FOR NOW)
      * The _setSelectedShapeAttributes_ implementation now uses new shape and textbox IDs as described below
      * BUG: Edit Circle (e.g., radius, or x/y), click Update button, see that the drawing updates. But if you then click on the Circle that you just updated, it disappears. Immediately click on Menu button and see that Object Info still shows the info for the Circle. In fact, you can edit/update it and it redraws the circle again.  So it's still there, but need to figure out why it hides when clicked
      * BUG2: If you use the Delete key to delete a shape while the Object Info tab is open, the Object Info tab does not get cleared
  * In index.html added calls to _setShapeID_ (new function in [sidebar.js][1]) to give shapes unique ID names when created instead of them being "undefined"
  * Added logic to _createShapeAttributeString_ to give unique IDs to shape-editing textboxes in the Object Info tab 
    * Can be used for future development of convert to code function as well as current implementation of update button
* Minor error message cleanup
* Continued lessons in HTML, CSS, and Javascript at [W3Schools.com][3]
* Continued [Konva][4] tutorials
