# Weekly Update 2018-11-27

* The project can be seen in action at [http://weblab.cs.uml.edu/~ahale/513_f2018/][2]
* Added first pass of HTML code generation and download
  * To try it click the new "Save" button
  * Most of the work this week was researching how to make this work using StackOverflow and the Konva library documentation as guides
    * In this first version, the generated HTML simply includes a background image of the entire drawing. Future versions will generate HTML that processes each shape individually, including image data and positioning via CSS
  * Due to the two bugs below, you can add as many shapes to the drawing as you want, but if you update any of them the "Save" button will not work
  * Bugs still remaining from previous commit on 11-20-2018:
    * BUG: Edit Circle (e.g., radius, or x/y), click Update button, see that the drawing updates. But if you then click on the Circle that you just updated, it disappears. Immediately click on Menu button and see that Object Info still shows the info for the Circle. In fact, you can edit/update it and it redraws the circle again.  So it's still there, but need to figure out why it hides when clicke
    * BUG2: If you use the Delete key to delete a shape while the Object Info tab is open, the Object Info tab does not get cleared
* Continued lessons in HTML, CSS, and Javascript at [W3Schools.com][3]
* Continued [Konva][4] tutorials
