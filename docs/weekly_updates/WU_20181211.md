# Weekly Update 2018-12-11

* The project can be seen in action at [http://weblab.cs.uml.edu/~ahale/513\_f2018/][1]
    * Note this project requires an HTML 5 browser, such as recent versions of Chrome and Firefox
    * To see the generated HTML, add some shapes to the canvas, maybe update a few, then click the Save button. Open the saved HTML in a browser, and then view source code. (Right click on the page and select View Page Source.)
* Code and feature updates this week
    * Functionality:
        * Simplified clicking/selecting Shapes to be more intuitive, no double-clicking needed anymore
            * The Object Info tab is updated "live" while dragging or transforming a Shape
            * Low priority TODO: Sometimes the Shape Transformer disappears after dragging is done
                * Work-around is to click the Shape again to reselect it and display the Transformer again
        * Implement updating via the Object Info tab for the remaining implemented Shapes
            * Done except for low-priority bugs with Line (BUG3 below) and Image (BUG4 below)
                * Both bugs have work-arounds as described below
            * Added _strokeEnabled_ edit checkbox for each shape, to allow completely disabling an outline, since setting an outline width to zero is insufficient in Konva to hide the outline entirely
        * In the generated HTML, use the correct top left point for each shape and rotation
            * Used [Konva Shape _getClientRect_ method][2] in our _generateHTML_ function
            * This is working for for all Shapes and rotations except for _rotated_ Text. See BUG1 below, which may be due to a bug in Konva.
                * After much reading (see below), decided rotated text is not critical for v1 of this app, time is better spent on other issues, so simply disabled rotation for Konva Text objects
        * When generating Text, convert newlines to `<br>` tags
            * Done using the JavaScript String function `replace(/\r\n/g, "<br>")..replace(/\n/g, "<br>")`
        * Z ordering
            * Z ordering is specified by the user simply by starting to drag a shape, which will move it to the top of the Z ordering. The Z ordering visible in the drawing area is preserved in the generated HTML.
            * Z ordering in the generated HTML uses the Konva Shape _getAbsoluteZIndex_ function
                * https://konvajs.github.io/api/Konva.Shape.html#getAbsoluteZIndex]\_\_anchor
        * Make Image source URL editable
            * Done, with some caveats for security as described below. The user updates the Image source URL by hand-entering the URL
                * https://stackoverflow.com/a/43093228
                * Add an attribute to the HTML Image to point back to the Konva Image then, when the Image source URL is updated, use this to reset the size of the Konva Image to the natural size of the new image after onload.
                    * https://stackoverflow.com/a/757848
            * For security reasons, the source of an Image must be _Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) compliant_.
                * Local files must be selected by the user via a file dialog: https://stackoverflow.com/a/21790019
                * Remote files must have appropriate permissions, which is dependent on the configuration of the web server, and is out of our control: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS\_enabled\_image
                    * There may be a hacky way around this using a _cross origin proxy_ but that would require searching for a reliable one. Tried https://crossorigin.me/ but it kept timing out. Not going to pursue this for now.
                * If the user sets a bad Image URL (non-CORS-compliant or simply a typo), catch the exception, show an error message with suggestions, and restore the prior image. Without this, the exception would be visible only in the JavaScript console.
                    * The error message is a modal pop-up based on https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto\_css\_modals.asp
        * Hid unimplemented Shape buttons in Toolbar tab
        * Cleaner format for Object Info tab - two column table, left side is right-justified and vice-versa
            * Done, took some work once discovered that _insertAdjacentHTML_ will auto-complete any incomplete HTML tags given to it
    * Code cleanup:
        * image\_icon.png (the Yoda image) had an outline built into the image which was distracting - cropped it out.
    * For future improvements
        * Implement Load WIP to/from a file - maybe embed JSON in comment of generated HTML?
        * Edit border for Text boxes and maybe other shapes
        * Explicitly edit scroll bars for Text boxes and/or resize box to fit
            * https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr\_pos\_overflow.asp
        * Set properties for background including image/color/pattern of body, title of page, etc.
* Problems and how they were solved
    * One of the most challenging problems this week was how to convert Images to Data URIs for the generated HTML. This led to a significant security issue that required a lot of research into Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). The end result was the need to develop a modal error dialog and provide more options for Images, including loading them from local files. For more info, see the discussion above about CORS-compliant Images.
    * Check box elements not retaining "false" (unchecked) state properly
        * Learned the best way to set a DOM element's boolean attribute to false is to remove it entirely by calling _removeAttribute_. Fixed.
            * https://stackoverflow.com/a/9201499
    * Problems remaining
        * BUG1: Positioning of _rotated_ Text objects is wrong. Unrotated Text objects are placed correctly
            * Suspect there is a bug in Konva's _getClientRect_ method implementation for Text objects
            * To work around the bug for Text, must calculate the top left point. It appears rotation is around the center of the Text object.
            * Fixing this is low priority for v1 of the app, simply disabled rotating text for now
        * BUG2: If Fill Enabled is false in a Text object, then you can no longer select it (intermittent?)
            * Initially thought this only happened when Text Outline Width is zero, but it happens even when non-zero
            * Low Priority TODO: Need to retest, it's possible this was fixed with other changes
        * BUG3: Double click Line, then drag or reshape the Transformer, Line flies off canvas
            * Work-around is to reshape or reposition by editing in Object Info tab
        * BUG4: Select Image, set width/height in Object Info tab, click Update, the Image reverts to its original size
            * Work-around is to do final sizing using Transformer - what is seen in the drawing area is what will be reflected in the generated HTML
        * (From 2018-12-04) Text outlines are not included in the generated HTML; the standards are lacking for this
