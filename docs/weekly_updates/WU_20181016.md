# Weekly Update 2018-10-16

I started experimenting with the interaction of HTML DIVs, CSS styles, and Konva Stages and Layers. One of the most impactful lessons I learned is that I can't have the shape pallette and the main drawing area in separate Konva Stages and be able to drag a shape from one to the other. The UX will need to be that the user clicks a shape in the pallette to select it as the current tool. Then move the mouse (without dragging) to the drawing area to draw that shape from scratch.
